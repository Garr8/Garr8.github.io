<h1><marquee>Personal Freelancing Site</marquee></h1>


<p>I just entered the freelancing world and I want to provide you with the opportunity to have your very own website for
your business or any other need. I use Notepad as the primary tool for writing html (the code that websites are written in.)
The software usually comes on your computer. I plan to procure Microsoft Expression Web, another software tool for creating 
websites. You can contact me via email at [email address] I am also available on Facebook
and LinkedIn.</p>
